# PERN-Chat
Here is my App deployed on Heroku:https://pern-messaging-app.herokuapp.com (it needs a little time to load because Heroku puts them in sleep if they are not used)
Hello, I created PERN application based on this guide video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBr-PybP_9c&t=5321s.
I added backend database as PostgreSQL and used Redux store instead of contexts.
Also, I added Google sign in with Passport.js, but it works with only pre-defined User Emails and it needs HTTPS to fix.
I did not wanted to create OAuth login because I decided to not store passwords for my Users.
